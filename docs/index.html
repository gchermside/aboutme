          <p>I worked in a group of three over a 4-month period to program a website where ASL learners and signers could sign into a computer screen to look up the English translation of a sign. A used a library that tracks a hand on a video, and the data captured is processed by a machine learning algorithm I wrote to translate it. New data and signs can also be entered on the website to allow for growth.</p>

          <p>This game gives the user 24-cards in one of three sizes. For each card, the user must find a solution using the four numbers provided that when added, multiplied, subtracted, or divided makes 24. If the user cannot come up with the solution, the program can also tell them the answer. To build this I created three programs, one that makes valid 24-cards, one that finds solutions to a given card, and one that combines them all to allow users to play the game.</p>

          <p>This is a program where you can play a 20-questions like game with characters from Harry Potter. Think of a character, and the program will ask you yes or no questions till it can guess the character you're thinking of. If the program guesses wrong, it will ask for your character and a question to differentiate that character with the incorrect guess. This is will be saved so the program can guess the character in future games.</p>

The codemasters know which words are sectretly their words, and they must give one word clues to make the user guess their color words. This website lets users, on one laptop, play this game.</p>
